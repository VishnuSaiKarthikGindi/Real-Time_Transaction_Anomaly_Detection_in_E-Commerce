### Real-Time Transaction Monitoring and Anomaly Detection in E-commerce
The Real-Time E-Commerce Transaction Monitoring System is designed to provide an efficient, scalable solution for tracking, processing, and analyzing e-commerce transactions as they occur. The system aims to detect unusual purchasing patterns and potential fraudulent activities using a rule-based anomaly detection approach, ultimately enabling businesses to enhance their operational efficiency and improve customer experience.

#### Objectives
- **Data Ingestion**: Continuously collected transaction data from an external streaming API to ensure that all relevant transactional information is captured in real-time.
- **Data Processing**: Transformed and prepared the ingested data for analysis using Apache Kafka and PySpark, allowing for rapid and scalable data processing.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implemented rule-based methods to identify anomalies in transaction data, such as unusually high or low transaction amounts, suspicious transaction timing, geolocation discrepancies, and unusual purchasing patterns.
- **Data Storage**: Store the processed and flagged transaction data in a relational or NoSQL database, facilitating real-time querying and historical analysis.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards that provide real-time insights into transaction patterns, flag anomalies, and allow for quick decision-making.

#### Technical Stack
- **Data Ingestion**: Apache Airflow for orchestration and automation of the data pipeline.
- **Data Streaming**: Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and messaging.
- **Data Processing**: PySpark for data transformation and processing, leveraging its distributed computing capabilities.
- **Database**: Apache Cassandra for storing processed transaction data, providing high availability and scalability.
- **Visualization**: Tools such as Tableau or Grafana for creating interactive dashboards that visualize transaction trends and anomalies.

#### Anomaly Detection Approach
The project utilizes a series of rule-based methods for anomaly detection, focusing on the following criteria:
1. **Threshold Rules**: Identify transactions that exceed predefined limits (e.g., high transaction amounts, excessive transactions in a short period).
2. **Time-Based Rules**: Flag transactions that occur during unusual hours, suggesting potential fraudulent behavior.
3. **Geolocation Anomalies**: Detect inconsistencies in customer locations, such as purchasing from geographically distant places within a short timeframe.
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Recognize unusual purchasing behaviors, such as bulk buying or multiple failed payment attempts, indicating possible fraud.

#### Benefits
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Immediate visibility into transaction activities, enabling rapid response to potential fraud.
- **Improved Customer Experience**: By identifying anomalies early, businesses can mitigate issues that may impact customers.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Interactive dashboards provide insights that help stakeholders make informed decisions based on current transaction data.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to handle growing volumes of transactions as the business expands, ensuring the system remains responsive and effective.
